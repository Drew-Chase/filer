# Setup Implementation Checklist

This document outlines the implementation status of various configuration options in the Filer setup process.

## Storage Configuration
- [x] Root Path (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Indexing Enabled (Implemented Correctly)
   - Default values aligned between frontend and backend
   - Functionality is implemented correctly in the backend
- [x] File Watcher Enabled (Implemented Correctly)
   - Default values aligned between frontend and backend
   - Functionality is implemented correctly in the backend
- [x] Filter Mode Whitelist (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Filter Patterns (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Included Extensions (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Exclude Hidden Files (Implemented Correctly)
   - Default values aligned between frontend and backend
   - Now properly used in file filtering logic

## Network Configuration
- [x] Port (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] HTTP Root Path (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] UPnP Enabled (Implemented Correctly)
   - Port forwarding now provides proper error feedback to the frontend
   - UPnP errors are properly handled and reported
- [x] Authorized Hosts (Implemented Correctly)
   - IP filtering middleware now restricts access based on the authorized hosts list
   - Unauthorized requests receive a 403 Forbidden response with a clear error message
- [x] CORS Enabled (Implemented Correctly)
   - CORS headers are now properly applied based on the configuration
   - Cross-origin requests are handled according to the CORS configuration

## Account Configuration
- [x] Default Admin User (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] User Management (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] User Permissions (Implemented Correctly)

## Missing Configuration Options
- [x] Max File Size (Removed from frontend code, not needed in Configuration struct)
- [x] Enable Thumbnails (Removed from frontend code, not needed in Configuration struct)

## Implementation Issues
1. **Default Value Mismatches**: ✓ Fixed - Default values are now aligned between frontend and backend:
   - `indexing_enabled`: true in both backend and frontend
   - `file_watcher_enabled`: true in both backend and frontend
   - `exclude_hidden_files`: true in both backend and frontend

2. **Inconsistent Configuration Requests**: ✓ Fixed - The referenced fields have been removed from the frontend code:
   - `max_file_size` - No longer referenced in StorageStep.tsx
   - `enable_thumbnails` - No longer referenced in StorageStep.tsx

3. **Error Handling**: The frontend properly handles API errors, but there's no validation of configuration values before sending to the backend.
