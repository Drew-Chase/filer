# Setup Implementation Checklist

This document outlines the implementation status of various configuration options in the Filer setup process.

## Storage Configuration
- [x] Root Path (Implemented Correctly)
- [ ] Indexing Enabled (Implemented Flawed)
   - Default is false in backend but true in frontend
   - Functionality is implemented correctly in the backend
- [ ] File Watcher Enabled (Implemented Flawed)
   - Default is false in backend but true in frontend
   - Functionality is implemented correctly in the backend
- [x] Filter Mode Whitelist (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Filter Patterns (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] Included Extensions (Implemented Correctly)
- [ ] Exclude Hidden Files (Implemented Flawed)
   - Default is false in backend but true in frontend
   - Not actually used in file filtering logic despite being in the configuration

## Network Configuration
- [x] Port (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] HTTP Root Path (Implemented Correctly)
- [ ] UPnP Enabled (Implemented Flawed)
   - Port forwarding is saved to config but fails silently with only error logs
   - No user feedback when port forwarding fails
- [ ] Authorized Hosts (Implemented Flawed)
   - Configuration is saved but not actually used to restrict access
   - No IP filtering middleware is applied to the Actix web server
- [ ] CORS Enabled (Implemented Flawed)
   - Configuration is saved but not actually used in the server
   - No CORS middleware is applied to the Actix web server

## Account Configuration
- [x] Default Admin User (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] User Management (Implemented Correctly)
- [x] User Permissions (Implemented Correctly)

## Missing Configuration Options
- [ ] Max File Size (Referenced in CreateStorageConfigRequest but not in Configuration struct)
- [ ] Enable Thumbnails (Referenced in CreateStorageConfigRequest but not in Configuration struct)

## Implementation Issues
1. **Default Value Mismatches**: Several configuration options have different default values between frontend and backend:
   - `indexing_enabled`: false in backend, true in frontend
   - `file_watcher_enabled`: false in backend, true in frontend
   - `exclude_hidden_files`: false in backend, true in frontend

2. **Inconsistent Configuration Requests**: The frontend components reference fields that don't exist in the backend Configuration struct:
   - `max_file_size` in StorageStep.tsx
   - `enable_thumbnails` in StorageStep.tsx

3. **Error Handling**: The frontend properly handles API errors, but there's no validation of configuration values before sending to the backend.
