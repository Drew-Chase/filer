# Filer Project Improvement Plan

This document outlines the prioritized plan for implementing improvements to the Filer project based on the tasks listed in `tasks.md`.

## Priority Levels

Tasks are categorized into the following priority levels:

- **P0 (Critical)**: Must be addressed immediately as they affect core functionality or security
- **P1 (High)**: Should be addressed in the short term to improve stability and user experience
- **P2 (Medium)**: Important improvements that should be addressed after P0 and P1 tasks
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have improvements that can be addressed when time permits

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

Focus on core architecture, security, and code quality improvements that will provide a solid foundation for future work.

#### P0 Tasks:
- Implement a more robust error handling system with custom error types
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Implement proper error propagation instead of unwrapping
- Add input validation for all API endpoints
- Implement CSRF protection for all API endpoints
- Implement proper input sanitization for all user inputs

#### P1 Tasks:
- Refactor authentication middleware to use a more modular approach
- Add request validation middleware for all API endpoints
- Refactor large functions in filesystem_endpoint.rs to improve readability
- Remove code duplication in file operation functions
- Add security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Implement proper session management with expiration

### Phase 2: Performance and User Experience

Focus on improving performance and user experience after the foundation is solid.

#### P1 Tasks:
- Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed filesystem entries
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

#### P2 Tasks:
- Implement state management using React Context or Redux
- Create a service layer for API communication
- Implement a theme system with light/dark mode support
- Add compression for API responses
- Optimize file upload/download with streaming
- Implement drag-and-drop for file operations
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Scalability

Focus on adding advanced features and improving scalability after the core functionality is solid and performant.

#### P2 Tasks:
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Create a more comprehensive logging strategy with different log levels for production
- Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Add file preview for common file types
- Implement search suggestions and filters

#### P3 Tasks:
- Implement a plugin system for extensibility
- Add internationalization support
- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Add user preferences and settings
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices

### Phase 4: DevOps and Documentation

Focus on improving the development process and documentation.

#### P2 Tasks:
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add user documentation with usage examples
- Create developer documentation for contributing
- Add inline code comments for complex logic

#### P3 Tasks:
- Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Add Docker support for containerized deployment
- Implement automated code quality checks
- Add dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities
- Implement semantic versioning

## Task Selection Guidelines

When selecting the next task to implement, consider the following:

1. Follow the priority order (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
2. Within a priority level, select tasks that:
   - Have the highest impact on the project
   - Have the fewest dependencies on other unimplemented tasks
   - Align with your expertise and available time
3. After completing a task, update `tasks.md` by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task

## Progress Tracking

As tasks are completed, they will be marked as done in `tasks.md`. Regular reviews of this plan will be conducted to adjust priorities as needed based on project evolution and feedback.
